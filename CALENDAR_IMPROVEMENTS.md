## 🔄 Navigation Flow

```
Year View (12 months overview)
  └─> Click month → Month View (calendar grid)
        └─> Click day → Day View (hourly schedule)
            └─> Can switch to Week View via switcher

OR use keyboard shortcuts (D/W/M/Y) to jump directly
OR use view switcher in header
```

---

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

1. **Memoization**: All event filtering and grouping uses `useMemo`
2. **Event Callbacks**: Used `useCallback` for handlers
3. **Smart Filtering**: Events filtered once at Calendar level, passed to views
4. **Lazy Calculations**: Event positioning calculated only when needed
5. **Efficient Rendering**: Only visible events rendered in time grids

---

## 🧪 Testing Completed

✅ Month View: Displays events correctly, click handlers work  
✅ Week View: Hourly grid renders, all-day events separate, timed events positioned  
✅ Day View: Single day focus, overlapping events handled, current time indicator  
✅ Year View: 12 months render, event indicators work, navigation works  
✅ View Switcher: All 4 views switch correctly, responsive on mobile  
✅ Keyboard Shortcuts: All shortcuts work, no conflicts with inputs  
✅ Date Navigation: Previous/Next/Today works in all views  
✅ Event Filtering: Search and filters apply to all views  
✅ Linting: Zero errors across all files
