/*
=== FUNCTIONALITY NOT USED ===

Text extraction capabilities that were implemented but not integrated:
- DOCX file text extraction using mammoth
- OCR text extraction using tesseract.js
- Integration with R2 file storage

File types supported:
- Microsoft Word (.docx)

can be used as a starting point.
